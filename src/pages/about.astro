	<p>
		I build systems — digital, emotional, spiritual, and physical.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm a technical program manager, software architect, and developer with over a decade of experience building scalable products. I've founded companies, led teams, and shipped software used by millions. Now I split my time between building tools, raising my kids, and building a homestead in Puerto Rico.
	</p>

	<p>
		But that's just part of it.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm also a father, artist, martial artist, mentor, and the founder of <strong>Strong Hands, Soft Heart</strong> — a brand devoted to practical strength, emotional depth, and sacred self-reliance.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I document it all:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Systems & strategy</strong> — software, automation, digital independence</li>
		<li><strong>Emotional alchemy</strong> — fatherhood, breathwork, discipline, rites of passage</li>
		<li><strong>DIY creation</strong> — homesteading, screen printing, beard oils, cooking</li>
		<li><strong>Poetry & music</strong> — creative expression, legacy, and inner truth</li>
		<li><strong>Learning projects</strong> — knowledge sprints, mastery logs, teaching back</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I don't build for algorithms. I build for real life.
